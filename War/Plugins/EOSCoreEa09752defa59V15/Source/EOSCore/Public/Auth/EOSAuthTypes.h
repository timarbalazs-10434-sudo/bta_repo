	 *
	 * @details The flow is as following:
	 * 1. Game initiates the user login flow by calling EOS_Auth_Login API with the EOS_LCT_DeviceCode login type.
	 * 2. The SDK internally requests the authentication backend service to begin the login flow, and returns the game
	 * a new randomly generated device code along with authorization URL information needed to complete the flow.

	 * 3. Game presents the device code and the authorization URL information on screen to the end-user.
	 * 4. The user will login to their Epic Account using an external device, e.g. a mobile device or a desktop PC,
	 * by browsing to the presented authentication URL and entering the device code presented by the game on the console.
	 * 5. Once the user has successfully logged in on their external device, the SDK will call the EOS_Auth_Login callback
	 * once more with the operation result code. If the user failed to login within the allowed time before the device code
	 * would expire, the result code returned by the callback will contain the appropriate error result.
	 *
	 * @details After logging in a local user for the first time, the game can remember the user login to allow automatically logging
	 * in the same user the next time they start the game. This avoids prompting the same user to go through the login flow
	 * across multiple game sessions over long periods of time.
	 * To do this, after a successful login using the EOS_LCT_DeviceCode login type, the game can call the EOS_Auth_CopyUserAuthToken API
	 * to retrieve a long-lived refresh token that is specifically created for this purpose on Console. The game can store
	 * the long-lived refresh token locally on the device, for the currently logged in local user of the device.
	 * Then, on subsequent game starts the game can call the EOS_Auth_Login API with the previously stored refresh token and

	 * @details On Console, login flow when the platform user account has not been linked with an Epic account yet:

	 *    - During the login process, the user will be able to login to their existing Epic account or create a new account if needed.
	 * 4. EOS_Auth_LinkAccount will make an intermediate callback to provide the caller with EOS_Auth_PinGrantInfo struct set in the EOS_Auth_LoginCallbackInfo data.
	 * 5. Game examines the retrieved EOS_Auth_PinGrantInfo struct for a website URI and user code that the user needs to access off-device via a PC or mobile device.
	 *    - Game visualizes the URI and user code so that the user can proceed with the login flow outside the console.
	 *    - In the meantime, EOS SDK will internally keep polling the backend for a completion status of the login flow.
	 * 6. Once user completes the login, cancels it or if the login flow times out, EOS_Auth_LinkAccount makes the second and final callback to the caller with the operation result status.
	 *    - If the user was logged in successfully, EOS_EResult::EOS_Success is returned in the EOS_Auth_LoginCallbackInfo. Otherwise, an error result code is returned accordingly.
	 *
	 * @details On Desktop and Mobile, login flow when the platform user account has not been linked with an Epic account yet:
	 * 1. Game calls EOS_Auth_Login with the EOS_LCT_ExternalAuth credential type.
	 * 2. EOS_Auth_Login returns EOS_EResult::EOS_InvalidUser with a non-null EOS_ContinuanceToken in the EOS_Auth_LoginCallbackInfo data.
	 * 3. Game calls EOS_Auth_LinkAccount with the EOS_ContinuanceToken to initiate the login flow for linking the platform account with the user's Epic account.
	 * 4. EOS SDK automatically opens the local default web browser and takes the user to the Epic account portal web page.
	 *    - The user is able to login to their existing Epic account or create a new account if needed.
	 *    - In the meantime, EOS SDK will internally keep polling the backend for a completion status of the login flow.
	 * 5. Once user completes the login, cancels it or if the login flow times out, EOS_Auth_LinkAccount invokes the completion callback to the caller.
	 *    - If the user was logged in successfully, EOS_EResult::EOS_Success is returned in the EOS_Auth_LoginCallbackInfo. Otherwise, an error result code is returned accordingly.
